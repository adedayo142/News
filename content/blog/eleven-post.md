The Colombia international was a top target for manager Jurgen Klopp in the summer, but interest from Tottenham this month accelerated their plans.

Spurs wanted to sign Diaz during the current window and were willing to pay up to £46m, but the winger preferred a move to Liverpool.



Diaz underwent a medical in Argentina as he is on international duty with Colombia for their World Cup qualifiers.



He played in both of Porto's matches against Liverpool in the Champions League this season, but was unable to help them avoid a 5-1 home defeat in September or a 2-0 loss at Anfield in November.


The deal represents a big coup for Julian Ward, who is set to succeed Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards in the summer, as he took the reins in negotiations.

Diaz requires a work permit to enter the UK, meaning he is unlikely to arrive in Liverpool until the end of next week at the earliest.

Liverpool's next match is at home to Cardiff in the FA Cup on Sunday, February 6.

Liverpool's No 23 shirt and its legendary owners
Luis Diaz will be among good company when he pulls on his new No 23 shirt for the first time. The number was assigned to Liverpool legends Jamie Carragher and Robbie Fowler during their time at Anfield, while Emre Can and Xherdan Shaqiri are more recent recipients of the honour.
