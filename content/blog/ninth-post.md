# Microsoft's Activision deal has on virtual goggles - Reuters


NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s deal to splash out $69 billion for Activision Blizzard (ATVI.O) makes a lot of sense, virtually. The software giant is paying a huge premium for its gaming rival, which should help it take on other technology giants in the metaverse. The problem is that in real-life, the deal is likely to catch the attention of watchdogs, who have mostly let the $2.3 trillion company skate by.
